This project is an example of Object Oriented Programming in C++, written for EC311 - Intro to Software Engineering. 

Project Overview:
In this programming assignment, you will be implementing a “simulation” similar to “Pokemon,” consisting of objects located in a two-dimensional world that move around and behave in
various ways. The user enters commands to tell the objects what to do, and they behave in simulated time. Simulated time advances one “tick” or unit at a time. Time is “frozen” while the
user enters commands. When the user commands the program to “go”, time will advance one tick of time. When the user commands the program to “run”, time will advance several units of
time until some significant event happens.
