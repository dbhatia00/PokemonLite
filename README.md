This project is an example of Object Oriented Programming in C++, written for EC327 - Intro to Software Engineering. 

Project Overview:
In this program, I have implemented a “simulation” similar to Pokemon, consisting of objects located in a two-dimensional world that move around and behave in various ways. The user enters commands to tell the objects what to do, and they behave in simulated time. Simulated time advances one “tick” or unit at a time. Time is “frozen” while the user enters commands. When the user commands the program to “go”, time will advance one tick of time. When the user commands the program to “run”, time will advance several units of time until some significant event happens.
